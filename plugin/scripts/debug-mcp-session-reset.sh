# debug-mcp-session-reset.sh — SessionStart hook.
#
# Resets the per-session nudge throttle written by debug-mcp-nudge.sh so the
# debug-MCP guidance re-injects whenever the model's context is wiped or
# replaced. SessionStart fires with a `source` discriminator:
#   startup  - fresh session
#   resume   - --continue / --resume
#   clear    - the user ran /clear  (context wiped, model forgot the nudge)
#   compact  - context was compacted (nudge may have been summarized away)
# In every one of these cases the model no longer reliably holds the earlier
# nudge, so we drop THIS session's stamp files to let the next qualifying Bash
# command nudge again. This is the fix for "the nudge stays silent after /clear
# even though the model lost the guidance."
#
# Fails open (always exit 0, no stdout) — must never disrupt session startup.
